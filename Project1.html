<h2>Sabletine — http://sabletine.com/index.html</h2>

<p><strong>1.</strong> My first impression was that the site looks calm and a little fancy, like a French bakery.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> The site has a simple layout with a menu on the top and big photos under it.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> It mostly makes sense to me because the pages are simple, but some pages feel a bit empty.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> The graphics help the site because the photos look nice and match the bakery feeling.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> The home page loaded very fast, so I think the load time was good.</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> The text was easy to read, and the plain background made it clear.</p>

<p><strong>7.</strong> Yes, it had a navigation bar on the top, and it was simple and easy to use.</p>

<p><strong>8.</strong> Yes, the site used the same calm colors and photo style on all pages.</p>

<p><strong>9.</strong> The layout breaks a little, so I think it is not fully responsive.</p>

<p><strong>10.</strong> The photos were very well done and made the bakery feel real and warm.</p>
